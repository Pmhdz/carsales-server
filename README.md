# Car Sales

## Project Idea

 My project idea is to be a car salesman and check what cars are in the inventory. My classmate gave me a idea when we were discussing how our project is going to be and I have a lot of love for cars so I kind of thought it would be a good idea to start with. I use this project if I ever want to try out the automotive industry.
