## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```md
 Is to be a car salesman and check what cars are in the inventory. My classmate gave me a idea when we were discussing how our project is going to be and I love a lot of love for cars so I kind of thought it would be a good idea to start with. I want it use it so if I ever want to try out the automotive industry. 
```

## Plan your resources

What resources will you need? What will the attributes and relationships be?

```md
resource = carSales
brand: String,
model: String, 
price: Number 
```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your resources are related to one another
(one to many, many to many, etc).

Include an image (or a link to image) below.

## Routing

What routes will you need to make the proper request to your API?

```md
 CRUD Create, Update, Delete 
```

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```md
 08/05 - finish planning, setup, and start backend
 08/06 - finish backend
 08/09 - work on frontend
 08/10 - finish frontend and start style 
 08/11 - deploy finally project before class start
```
